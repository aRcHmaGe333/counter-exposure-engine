## 🚨 Platforms That SCREAM Amateur

### ❌ AVOID These for Public Launch:

1. **Heroku free tier** - Everyone knows it sleeps
2. **Replit** - Associated with student projects
3. **GitHub Pages** - Fine for docs, not for apps
4. **Glitch.com** - Toy projects only
5. **000webhost** - Ad-laden, slow
6. **".herokuapp.com" domains** - Screams "free tier"
7. **".repl.co" domains** - Student project vibes

### ✅ Safe Choices:

1. **Custom domain** - ANY custom domain is 100x better
2. **Vercel** - Known for professionals
3. **Fly.io** - Respected in tech circles
4. **Digital Ocean** - Standard, reliable
5. **Render** - IF using paid tier with domain
6. **Railway** - IF using custom domain
